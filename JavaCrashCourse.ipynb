    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are one of the basic building blocks of a program. As mentioned previously, in writing a program we may want to manipulate some sort of data. That data needs to be stored somewhere and have some way for us to refer to it for later use. Variables are that storage and reference mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating variables to store data is often the first step in a program. This is refered to as \"declaring a variable.\" And to do so in Java, we write a command in the following format:  \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    <i>datatype</i> <i>variable_name</i>;\n",
    "</pre>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the format of programming language is usually refered to as the language's \"syntax.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigning Values to Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then give the variable a value, or \"assign\" the variable a value, with the following syntax:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    <i>variable_name</i> = <i>value</i>;\n",
    "</pre>  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also assign a variable a value when we first declare it. This is called \"initializing\" a variable, and is written like so:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    <i>datatype</i> <i>variable_name</i> = <i>value</i>;\n",
    "</pre>  "
